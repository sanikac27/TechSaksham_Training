# Day 1 - Linux Basics  
ðŸ“… **Date:** Tue 11/2  

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Linux
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system that powers a vast number of devices, from servers to mobile phones. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux gives users full control over system customization.

### ðŸ”¹ What is the Linux Kernel?
The **Linux kernel** is the core part of the operating system that directly interacts with the hardware. It manages system resources, such as memory, CPU, and devices, and provides a bridge between applications and hardware.

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Linux Commands
Here are some essential Linux commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `pwd` | Print the current working directory |
| `ls` | List files and directories in the current location |
| `cd <directory>` | Change directory |
| `mkdir <folder_name>` | Create a new directory |
| `touch <file_name>` | Create an empty file |
| `rm <file_name>` | Delete a file |
| `rmdir <directory>` | Remove an empty directory |
| `cp <source> <destination>` | Copy files or directories |
| `mv <source> <destination>` | Move or rename files |
| `cat <file_name>` | Display the contents of a file |
| `echo "text" > file.txt` | Write text to a file |
| `chmod +x <file>` | Make a file executable |
| `uname -a` | Show system information |
| `df -h` | Show disk usage |
| `free -m` | Show memory usage |

### ðŸ”¹ File and Directory Navigation
- `pwd`: Displays the current directory.
- `ls -la`: Lists files with detailed information, including hidden files.
- `cd ..`: Moves to the parent directory.
- `cd /`: Moves to the root directory.

### ðŸ”¹ Linux Kernel Components
The Linux Kernel consists of:
- **Process Management** - Handles process creation and execution.
- **Memory Management** - Allocates and manages system memory.
- **File System Management** - Organizes data storage and access.
- **Device Drivers** - Facilitates communication between hardware and software.
